# ClearHealth Design System Docs

This folder tracks the visual-system migration applied to ClearHealth-MVP while preserving existing business logic.

- `naironai-design-system.md`: token and UI rules
- `tooling-and-mcp.md`: registry/MCP/tooling setup
- `research-sources.md`: source links used for design decisions

Runtime orchestration now mirrors Better-T-Stack style local development using Turborepo (`web` + `server` tasks).
